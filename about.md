Hi, 

my name is Daniel de Santos Sierra, I've been working as Data Scientist since 
I finished my PhD on Biomedical Engineering. My main focus is on Big Data problems 
using Spark.

Currently, acting as Team Lead in a Data Scientist team of 8 people (and growing) at 
zooplus - 1st retail company for pet products in Europe.
